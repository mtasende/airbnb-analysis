# AirBnB Analysis
Analysis of open AirBnB data.

## Installations
This project was created using Python 3. To create the conda environment, and start working:
```
conda env create -f data.yml
source activate data
```
No extra libraries are needed.

## Project Motivation
Discuss what your project is about, and what interested you in pursuing the project.

## How to interact with the project
The results of the analysis can be found in the _reports_ folder.
Also, the notebooks in the _notebooks_ folder can be run, in order, to obtain the analysis results.
The `scratchpad` folder contains notebooks that should be ignored by the regular user.
